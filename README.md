Introducing the FRC Event HUB Discord Management Bot! This bot is designed to streamline communication and organization within your FRC server. Upon joining the server, users can select their team and be pinged for match queueing using FRC QUEUE. Once in the queue, they will be automatically placed into a group of channels with everyone in their alliance. These channels can be used for general communication, match planning using the built-in match planner, and communicating with alliance partners.

But that's not all! The bot also integrates with the Blue Alliance to provide scouting information for teams. Before each match, the bot will give you valuable information about your opponents, including a match predictor.

With the FRC Event HUB Discord Management Bot, you can ensure that your team is always up-to-date with the latest information and organized for success. Try it out today!
